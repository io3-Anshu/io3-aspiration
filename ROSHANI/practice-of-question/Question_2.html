        /** LARGEST SWAP **/
        /*  Write a function that takes a two digit number and determines  if it's the largest of
            two possible digit swaps . To illustrate:largestSwap(27) => false largestSwap(43) => true 
            if 27 is our input , we should return false because swapping the digits gives us 72, and 72 > 27.
            On the other hand , swapping 43 gives us 34, and 43 > ... */

        /** EXAMPLES
            Input: 2736
            Output :7236
            Explanation:
            If we swap the number 2 and the number
            7 then the generated number would be 
            the largest number.

            Input : 432
            Output : 432
            Explanation:
            Here, no swap is required. The given
            number is already largest.
