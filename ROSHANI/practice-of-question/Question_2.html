      /** LARGEST SWAP **/
      /*  Write a function that takes a two digit number and determines  if it's the largest of
                  two possible digit swaps . To illustrate:largestSwap(27) => false largestSwap(43) => true
                  if 27 is our input , we should return false because swapping the digits gives us 72, and 72 > 27.
                  On the other hand , swapping 43 gives us 34, and 43 > ... */

      /** EXAMPLES
                  Input: 2736
                  Output :7236
                  Explanation:
                  If we swap the number 2 and the number
                  7 then the generated number would be
                  the largest number.

                  Input : 432
                  Output : 432
                  Explanation:
                  Here, no swap is required. The given
                  number is already largest.
